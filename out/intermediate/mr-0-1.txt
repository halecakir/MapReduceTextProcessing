it
awakened

I
I

Quite

A
of

My

which
souls
which
are
so
closely
allied
It
was
a
wild
wind
was
outside
and
was
and
splashing
against
windows
Suddenly
amid
all
of
gale
wild
scream
of
a
woman
I
knew
it
was
my
sister
s
I
sprang
my
wrapped
a
shawl
me
and
into
corridor
As
I
opened
my
I
seemed
a
whistle
such
as
my
sister
and
a
moments
a
clanging
sound
as
if
a
mass
of
metal
As
I
my
sister
s
was
unlocked
and
slowly
upon
its
I
stared
at
it
stricken
knowing
what
was
about

I
saw
my

She
writhed

were
convulsed
At
I
she
me
as
I
over
she
suddenly
shrieked
out
in
a
which
I
shall
Oh
my
God
It
was
speckled

something
else
which
she

said
and
she
stabbed

When

sister

side
she
was
unconscious
and
and
sent
medical
aid
all
efforts
were
in
she
slowly
sank
and
without
consciousness
Such
was
end
of
my
sister
One
moment
said

you
sure
about
whistle
and
metallic
sound
Could
you
swear
it
was
what

me
at

A
of

over
me
Who

With

She
was
about

when
a
slammed
overhead

of

She

We
went
upstairs

I
stooped
and
was
scraping

I
a

And

If

Easier

Already
I

As

impression
as
young

your

swung

stared
into

she

a
considerable
A
more
is

in

of

you

And

On

at

moment
when
your

chivalrous
and
secret
And
was
why
she
shrieked
and
when
she
saw
coronet
cried
Mr
Oh
my
God
what

I
And
asking
allowed
go
out
minutes
wanted

misjudged

I
at

also

along

indistinguishable

at

without

anything
more
which
I
when
I
got
into

a
and
complex
story
was
written
in

in
of
me
was
a
of
of
a
man
and
a
second
which
I
saw
with
a
man
with
I
was
at
once
convinced
what
you
me
was
your
son
walked
ways
other
swiftly
and
as
was
marked
in
over
of
it
was
obvious
after
other
I
up
and
window
where
worn
all
snow
away
while
waiting
I
walked
other
end
which
was
a
yards
or
more
I
saw
where
where
snow
was
cut
up
as
a
struggle
and
where
a
of
show
me
I
was
mistaken
and
another
smudge
of
showed
it
was
who
When
came
at
other
end
I
cleared
so
was
an
end
clue
On
entering
I
examined
as
you
sill
and
of
window
with
my
and
I
could
at
once
see
someone
out
I
could
outline
of
an
instep
where
wet
in
coming
in
I
was
able
an
opinion
as
what
occurred
A
man
waited
outside

someone

overseen
your
son
struggled
with
each
at
coronet
united
strength
causing
injuries
which
alone
could
effected
with
a
in
grasp
of
opponent
So
I
was
clear
question
was
who
was
man
and
who
was
it
coronet
It
is
an
old
maxim
of
mine
when
you
excluded
impossible
whatever
improbable
must
I
knew
it
was
you
who
it
so
only
your
and
maids
if
it
were
maids
why
should
your
son
allow
accused
in
could
As
cousin
was
an
excellent
explanation
why
should

more
so
as
secret
was
a
one
When
I
you
seen
at
window
and
she
on
seeing
coronet
again
my
conjecture
a
certainty
And
who
could
it
who
was
confederate
A
evidently
who
else
could
outweigh
and
gratitude
which
she
must
you
I
knew
you
went
out
and
your
circle
of
was
a
one
among
was
Sir
George
I
of
as
a
man
of
evil
among
women
It
must
who
wore
and
missing
gems
Even
knew
Arthur
might
still
was
safe
could
say
a
word
without

It

A

me
Who

And

With

Within

When

Easier

Already

questioning
you
so
When
you
meet
Miss

San
a
year
ago
You
were
in
States
Yes
you
engaged

were
on

years
ago

came
up
and
what
is
your
own
impression
as
young

your
wife
s
character
swung
glasses

and
stared
into
You
see
Mr
said
my
wife

a

I
was
about
say
She
is

in
making
up
mind
and
in
carrying
out
On

I
would
given
which
I
gave
a

I
at
a

she

sacrifice
and
anything

I
with
me

and

St

came
and
you
your
acquaintance
Yes
over
season
I
met
several
engaged
and
married
She
I
understand
a
considerable
A
more
is
usual
in
my
And
of
course
you
since

a

I
made

Miss

Was
she
in

She
kept

Indeed
is
interesting
And
on

of

She
was
as
as
at

And
you
observe
any
change
in
Well
I
saw

and
it

worse
Yet
when
I
spoke
of
matter
she
answered
me
abruptly
and
in
carriage
on
our
way
she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
cause

she
on

I
saw
in

with

And
who

She

Alice
Oh
a
minutes
I
something
else
of
You
overhear
what
said
St
Simon
said
something
about
a
claim
She
was
accustomed
use
slang
of
kind
I
idea
what
she
meant
American
slang
is
expressive
sometimes
And
what
your
wife
when
she
speaking
maid
She
walked
into
On
your
arm
alone
She
was
independent
in
matters
after
we
sat
minutes
or
so
she
muttered
some
words
of
apology
and
She
came
maid
Alice
as
I
understand
she
went
covered
s
with
a
ulster
on
a
and
went
out
Quite
so
And
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
in
company
with
Millar
a
woman
who
is
in
custody
and
who
already
made
a
at
Mr
s
morning
Ah
yes
I
should
a
as
young
and
your
St

shrugged
shoulders
and
eyebrows
We

some
years
I
may
say
on

She
used
at
Allegro

ungenerously
and
she

of
complaint
against
me
you
know
what
women
are
Mr
was
a
exceedingly
and
attached
me
She
wrote
me
when
she
I
was
about
married
and
why
I
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
I
might
a
scandal
in
church
She
came
Mr
s
after
we
and
she
endeavoured
way
in
uttering
abusive
expressions
my
wife
and
even
I
of
something
of
sort
and
I
in
clothes
who
soon
out
again
She
was
quiet
when
she
saw
was
good
in
making
a
your
wife
all
goodness
she
And
she
was
seen
walking
with
woman
afterwards
Yes

what
Mr

upon
as
so
serious
It
is
my

and
some
Well
it
is
a
supposition
You
so
I

a
one
you

as
I
would

Still
is
a
strange
of
characters
what
is
your
own

what
Well
I
came

a
one
I
given
you
all
Since
you
ask
me
I
may
say
it
occurred
me
as
excitement
of

she
made
so
immense
a
social
stride
effect
of
causing
some
in
my

In
short
she
suddenly
Well
when
I
consider
she
I
will
say
upon
me
upon
so
much
many

without
success
I
can
explain
it
in

Well

St

Quite
so

My

questioning
you

When
you

were
in

came
up

what
is
your

impression
as
young

your

swung

and
stared
into

Mr

my
wife

was
about

and
in
carrying
out

I
would

which
I
gave
a

I
at
a

she

and
anything

I
with
me

earnestly

and

St

came

you
your

Yes
over
season
I
met
several
engaged

married
She
I
understand
a
considerable
A
more
is

in
my
And
of
course
you
since

I
made

she

on

was
as

any
change

I
saw

Yet
when
I
spoke
of

she
answered
me
abruptly
and
in

on

she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
cause

Alice
Oh
a
minutes
I
something
else
of
You
overhear
what
said
St
Simon
said
something
about
a
claim
She
was
accustomed
use
slang
of
kind
I
idea
what
she
meant
American
slang
is
expressive
sometimes
And
what
your
wife
when
she
speaking
maid
She
walked
into
On
your
arm
alone
She
was
independent
in
matters
after
we
sat
minutes
or
so
she
muttered
some
words
of
apology
and
She
came
maid
Alice
as
I
understand
she
went
covered
s
with
a
ulster
on
a
and
went
out
Quite
so
And
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
in
company
with
Millar
a
woman
who
is
in
custody
and
who
already
made
a
at
Mr
s
morning
Ah
yes
I
should
a
as
young
and
your
St

shrugged
shoulders
and
eyebrows
We

some
years
I
may
say
on

She
used
at
Allegro
I
ungenerously
and
she
cause
of
complaint
against
me
you
know
what
women
are
Mr
was
a
exceedingly
and
attached
me
She
wrote
me
when
she
I
was
about
married
and
why
I
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
I
might
a
scandal
in
church
She
came
Mr
s
after
we
and
she
endeavoured
way
in
uttering
abusive
expressions
my
wife
and
even
I
of
something
of
sort
and
I
in
clothes
who
soon
out
again
She
was
quiet
when
she
saw
was
good
in
making
a
your
wife
all
goodness
she
And
she
was
seen
walking
with
woman
afterwards
Yes
is
what
Mr
of
Scotland

upon
as
so
serious
It
is
my
wife
out
and
some
Well
it
is
a
supposition
You
so
I
say
a
one
you
yourself
upon
as
I
would

Still
is
a
strange
of
characters
what
is
your
own
as
what
Well
I
came
seek
a
one
I
given
you
all
Since
you
ask
me
I
may
say
it
occurred
me
as
excitement
of

consciousness
she
made
so
immense
a
social
stride

of
causing
some
in
my

In

she
suddenly
Well
when
I
consider
she
I
will
say
upon
me
upon
so
much
many
aspired
without
success
I
can
explain
it
in

Well
certainly

also
a

And
St

I
I
all

I
ask
whether

Quite
so
I
I
you
I
shall

Should
you

our

I
solved

Eh
What

I
solved

I
shall

It

I
I

my
