Why

My

You

When

And
as

scrapes

You

may
able
come
up
as
often
as

I
invented
an
invaluable
invalid

If

you
at
Willis

I
engaged
Aunt
Augusta
more
a
week
I
asked
you
with
me
anywhere
Algernon
I
know
You
are
absurdly
careless
about
sending
out

It
is
of
you
annoys
so
much
as

You

with
your
Aunt
Augusta
Algernon
I

So
I
am
going
get
of

And
I
strongly
advise
you

with
Mr

who

Algernon
will
induce
me
with
and
if
you
ever
get
married
which

know
A

If

It

Algernon
My
it
isn

such
a
of
competition
about

minutes
so

Algernon
Yes
you
must

years
younger
And
I

strange
Mr

Well
I
must
say
Algernon
I
it
is
Mr
made
up
mind
whether

going
or
shilly
shallying
with
question
is
absurd
I
in
any
way
approve
of
modern
sympathy

Illness

any

And

me
so
I
mean
something
else

age
of

expensive
monthly
magazines

metaphysical
speculation

metaphysical
speculations

Why

My
Algy
I
know
whether
you
will
able

my
motives
You
are
serious
enough
When

And
as

a

of
of

scrapes

You

You

Algernon
You

a
useful

may
able
come
up
as
often
as
you
I
invented
an
invaluable
invalid
called
in

may

into

If

I
wouldn

with
you
at
Willis
s
I
engaged
Aunt
Augusta
more
a
week
I
asked
you
with
me
anywhere
Algernon
I
know
You
are
absurdly
careless
about
sending
out
invitations
It
is
of
you
annoys
so
much
as

You

with
your
Aunt
Augusta
Algernon
I

So
I
am
going
get
of
Ernest
And
I
strongly
advise
you
same
with
Mr
with
your
invalid
who
absurd
Algernon
will
induce
me
with
and
if
you
ever
get
married
which
seems
me
extremely

will
glad
know
A

If
I

It

easy
cynical
Algernon
My
it
isn
easy
anything

such
a
of
competition
about

of

minutes
so

Gwendolen

you

I
suppose
so
if
you
want
Algernon
Yes
you
must

about
it
I
who

about

years
younger
And
I

cup
of

of
cucumber
sandwiches

Aunt
Augusta
Goes
over
Won

Exchanges

It
is
strange
Mr

curiously
Algernon
Yes

invalid
Well
I
must
say
Algernon
I
it
is
Mr
made
up
mind
whether

going
or
shilly
shallying
with
question
is
absurd
I
in
any
way
approve
of
modern
sympathy
with
invalids
I
consider
it
morbid
Illness

any

on
Saturday

on
you

cannot
allow

or
which
is
worse
German

Gwendolen
Charming

Miss
Gwendolen

about

Mr
Worthing
Whenever

I
always
quite
certain
mean
something
else
And
makes
me
so
I
mean
something
else
Gwendolen
I

In
I
am
wrong
And
I
would

way
of
coming
suddenly

Even
I
met
you
I
was
indifferent

in
amazement
We
as
I
you
know
Mr
Worthing
in
an
age
of
ideals

constantly
mentioned
in
more
expensive
monthly
magazines
and
I
am
and
my
ideal
always
some
one
of
of

Gwendolen

something
else
you
mean
say

couldn
me
Gwendolen
Glibly
Ah

clearly
a
metaphysical
speculation
and
most
metaphysical
speculations
at
all
actual
of
as
we
know
speak
quite
candidly
I
much
care
about
of
Ernest

Gwendolen
It
suits
you
It
is
a
It
a
music
of

It
Well
Gwendolen
I
must

So

She

Well

When

and
go
After

I
was
in
a
sweat

she

I
care
more
about
I
stock
in
soon
I
wanted

and
asked

She
said

I
must

you
see
yet
a
of
with

good
in
it
And
she

of
course
was
all
she

sister
Miss
Watson
a
slim
old
maid
with
goggles
on
come
with
and
a
set
at
me
with
a
spelling
She
worked
me
middling
about
an
and
widow
made
ease
up
I
couldn
stood
it
much
an
it
was
and
I
was
Miss
Watson
would
say
your
up
and
scrunch
up
set
up
straight
and
soon
she
would
say
gap
and
stretch
why
you
she

all
about
and
I
said
I
wished
I
was
She
got
mad
I
mean
All
I
wanted
was
go
somewheres
all
I
wanted
was
a
change
I
warn
She
said
it
was
wicked
say
what
I
said
said
she
wouldn
say
it
whole
world
she
was
going
so
as
go
good
Well
I
couldn
see
advantage
in
going
where
she
was
going
so
I
made
up
my
mind
I
wouldn
it
I
said
so
it
would
only
make
and
wouldn
good
she
got
a
start
and
she
went
on
and
me
all
about
good
She
said
all
a
would
was
go
around
all
with
a
and
sing
and
ever
So
I
much
of
it
I
said
so
I
asked
if
she
Sawyer
would
go
and
she
said
a
considerable
sight
I
was
glad
about
I
wanted
and
me
Miss
Watson
she
kept
at
me
and
it
got
and
and
in
and
and
everybody
was
off
I
went
up
my
with
a
of
candle
and
it
on
I
set
in
a
chair
window
and
of
something
cheerful
it
warn
use
I
so
I
most
wished
I
was
stars
were
shining
and
in
woods
ever
so
mournful
and
I
an
owl
away
off
who
whooing
about
somebody
was
and
a
whippowill
and
a
crying
about
somebody
was
going
and
wind
was
whisper
something
me
and
I
couldn
make
out
what
it
was
and
so
it
made
cold
shivers
over
me
away
out
in
woods
I
kind
of
a
sound
a
ghost
makes
when
it
wants
about
something
s
on
its
mind
and
can
make
itself
understood
and
so
can
easy
in
its
grave
and
go
about
way
every
grieving
I
got
so
and
scared
I
wish
I
some
company
soon
a
spider
went
crawling
up
my
shoulder
and
I
it
off
and
it
in
candle
and
I
could
it
was
all
shriveled
up
I
anybody
me
was
an
awful
sign
and
would
me
some
so
I
was
scared
and
most
shook
clothes
off
of
me
I
got
up
and
around
in

sometimes
you
could
a
sweep
screaking
or
up
it
was
so
still
and
sounds
come
so
and
and
you
could
see
a
streak
on
water
which
you
know
of
streak
s
a
snag
in
a
swift
current
which
on
it
and
makes
streak
way
and
you
see
mist
curl
up
off
of
water
and
east
up
and
and
you
make
out
a
cabin
in
edge
of
woods
away
on
on

side
of
a
woodyard
and
cheats
so
you
can

And
afterwards
we
would
watch
of
and
kind
of
along
and
and
off
sleep
Wake
up
and
and
see
what
it
and
maybe
see
a
steamboat
coughing
along
up
stream
so
off
other
side
you
couldn
about
only
whether
she
was
a
stern
wheel
or
side

So
I

We
stuck

about
a
an
which

So

So

I
says
when
we
get

only
scornful
and
said
something
about

an
idiotic
idea
and
went
studying
and
said

Said

could
see
a
streak
on
water
which

a
snag
in
a
swift
current
which
on

make
out
a
cabin

Wake
