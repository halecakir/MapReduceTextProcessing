questioning
you

When
you

year
ago
You
were
in

came
up

what
is
your
own
impression
as
young

your
wife
s
character
swung
glasses

and
stared
into

see
Mr

my
wife

I
was
about

and
in
carrying
out
On

I
would
given
which
I
gave
a

I
at
a

she

and
anything
would
you
I
with
me

and

St

young
came
and
you
your
acquaintance
Yes
over
season
I
met
several
engaged
and
married
She
I
understand
a
considerable
A
more
is
usual
in
my
And
of
course
you
since

is
a

I
made
inquiries

Miss

Yes
Was
she
in

She
kept

Indeed
is
interesting
And
on

of

She
was
as
as
at
until

And
you
observe
any
change
in
Well
I
saw

and
it

worse
Yet
when
I
spoke
of
matter
she
answered
me
abruptly
and
in

on
our
way
she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
cause

Alice
Oh
a
minutes
I
something
else
of
You
overhear
what
said
St
Simon
said
something
about
a
claim
She
was
accustomed
use
slang
of
kind
I
idea
what
she
meant
American
slang
is
expressive
sometimes
And
what
your
wife
when
she
speaking
maid
She
walked
into
On
your
arm
alone
She
was
independent
in
matters
after
we
sat
minutes
or
so
she
muttered
some
words
of
apology
and
She
came
maid
Alice
as
I
understand
she
went
covered
s
with
a
ulster
on
a
and
went
out
Quite
so
And
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
in
company
with
Millar
a
woman
who
is
in
custody
and
who
already
made
a
at
Mr
s
morning
Ah
yes
I
should
a
as
young
and
your
St

shrugged
shoulders
and
eyebrows
We
on

some
years
I
may
say
on

She
used
at
Allegro
I
ungenerously
and
she
cause
of
complaint
against
me
you
know
what
women
are
Mr
was
a
exceedingly
and
attached
me
She
wrote
me
when
she
I
was
about
married
and
why
I
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
I
might
a
scandal
in
church
She
came
Mr
s
after
we
and
she
endeavoured
way
in
uttering
abusive
expressions
my
wife
and
even
I
of
something
of
sort
and
I
in
clothes
who
soon
out
again
She
was
quiet
when
she
saw
was
good
in
making
a
your

all
goodness
she
And
she
was
seen
walking
with
woman
afterwards
Yes

what
Mr
of

upon
as
so
serious
It
is
my

some
Well
it
is
a

You
so
I

a
one

I

Still
is
a
strange
of

what
is
your

what
Well
I
came

a
one
I
given
you
all
Since
you
ask
me
I
may
say
it
occurred
me
as
excitement
of

she
made
so
immense
a
social
stride
effect
of
causing
some
in
my

In
short
she
suddenly
Well
when
I
consider
she
I
will
say
upon
me
upon
so
much
many
aspired
without
success
I
can
explain
it
in
any
other
Well
certainly

And
St

I
I
all

Quite
so

I
out
of
my
window
about
o

in
morning
It
was
a
moonlight
and
in
of
was
silvered
over
and
almost
as
as
I
was
standing
in
of
scene
when
I
was
aware
something
was
moving
under
shadow
of
copper
As
it
emerged
into
moonshine
I
saw
what
it
was
It
was
a
giant

It

mere
oversight
so
I
out

open
it

and
I
open
was
only
one
in
it
I
am
sure
you
would
guess
what
it
was
It
was
my
coil
of

up
and
examined

It
was
of

With

undid
my

identical
Was
it
extraordinary
as
I
would
I

curiosity
so
when
I
went
out

what
is
your

impression
as
young

swung

and
stared
into

in
carrying
out

I
would

which
I
gave

at

she

She

considerable
A
more
is

And
of

Yet
when
I
spoke

she
answered
me
abruptly
and
in

on

she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
cause

Oh
a
minutes
I
something
else
of
You
overhear
what
said
St
Simon
said
something
about
a
claim
She
was
accustomed
use
slang
of
kind
I
idea
what
she
meant
American
slang
is
expressive
sometimes
And
what
your
wife
when
she
speaking
maid
She
walked
into
On
your
arm
alone
She
was
independent
in
matters
after
we
sat
minutes
or
so
she
muttered
some
words
of
apology
and
She
came

Alice
as
I
understand
she
went
covered

with
a
ulster
on

and
went
out

so
And
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
in
company
with
Millar
a
woman
who
is
in
custody
and
who
already
made
a
at
Mr

Ah

against
me
you
know
what

Mr

a
exceedingly

attached
me
She
wrote
me
when
she
I
was
about
married
and
why
I
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
I
might
a
scandal
in
church
She
came
Mr

after
we
and
she
endeavoured
way
in
uttering
abusive
expressions
my
wife
and
even
I
of
something
of
sort
and
I
in

who
soon
out
again
She
was
quiet
when
she
saw

good
in

a
your

And
she
was
seen
walking
with
woman
afterwards
Yes

upon
as
so
serious
It
is
my

Well

in

It
was
a
moonlight
and
in
of
was
silvered
over

almost
as
as
I
was
standing
in
of
scene
when
I
was
aware
something
was
moving
under

As
it
emerged

what
Amy
was

stammer
an
awkward
assent

was
as
often
misplaced
as
otherwise
kept
